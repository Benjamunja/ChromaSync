**Effective Date: January 2025** **Last Updated: December 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to ChromaSync ("we," "our," "us," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application.

ChromaSync is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

- **Media Files**: When you select photos for editing or capture photos using the camera, these files are accessed only for processing purposes. All processing occurs locally on your device.
- **Custom Presets**: Any custom gradients, overlays, or filters you create are stored locally on your device using secure local storage (AsyncStorage).
- **App Settings**: Your preferences (such as water depth units, export quality, language preference) are stored locally on your device.

### 2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect

We are committed to your privacy. We do NOT collect:

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Location data (GPS coordinates, precise location)
- Contacts, calendar, or other personal data
- Biometric data
- Payment information (the App is free to use)
- Your photos (they never leave your device)
- Usage analytics or app activity tracking
- Device identifiers for tracking purposes (except as required by AdMob)

### 2.3 Automatic Information Collection

The App may automatically collect certain limited information necessary for functionality:
