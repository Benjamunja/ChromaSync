Welcome to ChromaSync ("we," "our," "us," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application.

By using ChromaSync, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our App.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly

ChromaSync is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

- **Media Files**: When you select photos for editing or capture photos using the camera, these files are accessed only for processing purposes. All processing occurs locally on your device.
- **Custom Presets**: Any custom gradients, overlays, or filters you create are stored locally on your device using secure local storage (AsyncStorage).
- **App Settings**: Your preferences (such as water depth units, export quality, language preference) are stored locally on your device.

### 2.2 Information We Do NOT Collect

We are committed to your privacy. We do NOT collect:

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, address)
- Precise location data (GPS coordinates)
- Contacts, calendar, or other personal data
- Biometric data
- Payment information (the App is free to use)
- Your photos (they never leave your device)
- Usage analytics or app activity tracking (except ad-related analytics handled by AdMob)

### 2.3 Automatic Information Collection

The App may automatically collect certain limited information necessary for functionality:

- **Device Information**: Basic device information (model, operating system version) may be collected by third-party services (Google AdMob) for advertising and tracking purposes.
- **App Version**: The App version may be displayed in settings for support purposes.

### 2.4 Data Used for Tracking

**Important**: The following data collected by third-party advertising services (Google AdMob) is used for tracking purposes:

- **Device Identifiers**: IDFA (iOS) and AAID (Android) are used to track your activity across apps and websites
- **Device Information**: Device characteristics used to build advertising profiles
- **Location Data**: General location (country/region) used for targeted advertising
- **Ad Interaction Data**: Information about how you interact with advertisements
- **IP Address**: Used for tracking and attribution purposes

This tracking data is used to:
- Link your activity across different apps and websites
- Deliver personalized advertisements
- Measure advertising effectiveness
- Build advertising profiles for targeted advertising

**Your Control**: You can limit or prevent tracking by adjusting your device settings as described in Section 7.3.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Data Collection

### 3.1 Google AdMob and User Tracking

ChromaSync uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. This service collects certain information to provide and improve advertising services, including for tracking purposes.

**Information Collected by AdMob (Used for Tracking):**
- **Device Identifiers**: Advertising IDs such as IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) on iOS and AAID (Android Advertising ID) on Android. These identifiers are used to track your activity across apps and websites owned by other companies for advertising purposes.
- **Device Information**: Device model, operating system version, screen resolution, and other technical specifications
- **Location Data**: General location data at the country/region level (not precise GPS coordinates)
- **App Usage Data**: Data related to ad interactions, including ad clicks, impressions, and engagement metrics
- **IP Address**: Anonymized IP address information
- **User Activity**: Information about your interactions with advertisements, which may be linked to your device identifier and used to track your activity across other apps and websites

**Tracking Across Apps and Websites:**
The data collected by AdMob, particularly device identifiers (IDFA/AAID), is used for tracking purposes. This means:
- Your device identifier may be shared with third-party advertising networks
- Your activity may be tracked across different apps and websites
- This tracking is used to deliver personalized advertisements and measure advertising effectiveness
- The tracking occurs even when you are not actively using ChromaSync

**App Tracking Transparency (iOS):**
- On iOS 14.5 and later, ChromaSync requests permission to track your activity across apps and websites for personalized advertising
- This permission is requested through the App Tracking Transparency framework
- You can choose to allow or deny this permission when prompted
- If you deny tracking permission, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant to your interests and tracking will be limited
- You can change this setting at any time in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking

**SKAdNetwork (iOS Attribution):**
ChromaSync uses Apple's SKAdNetwork for privacy-preserving ad attribution. This allows advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns without accessing your personal information. SKAdNetwork identifiers are used for attribution purposes and may be shared with advertising partners.

**How AdMob Uses This Information:**
- To show you relevant, personalized advertisements
- To track your activity across apps and websites for advertising purposes
- To measure ad performance and attribution
- To prevent fraud and abuse
- To comply with legal requirements
- To build advertising profiles for targeted advertising

**Your Control:**
You can opt out of personalized advertising and limit tracking by adjusting your device settings:

- **iOS**: 
  - Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > Turn off "Allow Apps to Request to Track"
  - Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking
- **Android**: 
  - Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization
  - Settings > Privacy > Ads > Reset advertising ID

**Important Note**: Even if you opt out of personalized advertising, you may still see ads, but they will be less relevant to your interests. Some data collection may still occur for basic ad serving and fraud prevention.
